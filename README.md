# Trainee Assessment Portal

The Trainee Assessment Portal (TAP) is envisioned to be a one-stop portal for both trainees and instructors to archive, monitor and process graded assessments. This project is tended for the fulfillment of the academic requirements of the Software engineering Immersive programme from General Assembly.

## Background

Trainees presently print out a hardcopy assessment form which their instructors will fill up as the session progresses. After the session is completed, trainees will file the assessment form in their training file for archival and for future instructors to view their progress.

Some issues with the present system is that forms may go missing during the course, causing a gap in the trainees' progress, or checks done at the end of the course highlight that some forms were not filled in according to audit standards.

With the current system of hardcopy assessment forms, any kind of processing requires staff to manually tabulate and analyse data to turn it into useful information.

## Description

The TAP's first goal is to reduce the excessive paper usage generated by the training process. While the TAP itself will not be able to achieve this goal, it takes the first step in the digitalisation of the training process. The TAP currently requires trainees to manually input their assessment details into the portal, but the envisioned outcome is for a digital device to be used during the session (instead of the hardcopy form) to input the assessment details directly into the portal.

THe TAP's second goal is to eliminate mistakes made in the process of filling up the assessment forms. The submission form for adding assessments has a comprehensive list of validations to ensure that the assessment details adhere to the strict audit standards. Trainees will not be able to submit the assessment if any of the criteria is not met.

The TAP's third goal is to provide instructors and management the ability to analyse and process the assessment data input by the trainees. The monitoring of a trainee's progress is crucial in providing a tailored training experience. Instructors need to be able to identify a trainee's strengths and weaknesses early on to maximise a trainee's potential. The TAP provides a dashboard with visual representations of both individual and aggregated data (not implemented yet) for instructors and management to easily obtain an overview of the status of training.

## Technologies Used

The TAP is a PERN stack application, utilising ReactTS for the front-end, ExpressJS for the back-end and Postgres for the database. The TAP is hosted in AWS utilising AWS's 12-month free services of EC2 and RDS (not implemented yet).

BCrypt is used for the hashing of passwords while JSONWebToken is used to manage local sessions.

Charts are generated using D3 and their associated libraries.

## Application Structure

Displayed below is the envisioned structure of the application. Components not yet implemented are indicated with a _[not implemented]_ tag.

```
--> Root (/)
    |--> Login (/login)
         |--> Login page for registered users.
         |--> Generates Refresh and Access Tokens. Refresh Token is stored in Local Storage.
         |--> Global states are automatically populated after login.
    |--> Account Creation (/register)
         |--> Account creation with username and password. All accounts are tagged as non-admin by default.
         |--> Counts as a login and thus will generate Refresh and Access Tokens. Refresh Token is stored in Local Storage.
         |--> Global states are automatically populated after account creation.
    |--> Home Dashboard (/home) [not implemented]
         |--> Dashboard Section to indicate a trainee's progress in their selected position. Includes Live-Sim Ratio, Average Grades, Scenario Percentage Completion and Training Deadlines
    |--> Assessments (/assessments)
         |--> Summary
              |--> Position Selector with a dropdown that includes all of the positions the trainee is training in or has trained in.
              |--> 'New Position' button for trainees to add a new position. [not implemented]

              |--> Trainee is able to add new assessments from this page through the 'Add Assessment' button
              |--> Each assessment is displayed as a row in the table. Trainees are able to edit the assessment details or delete the assessment if it is no longer required.
              |--> All available fields will be automatically populated when editing an assessment.
              |--> Validations are present in both 'Add' and 'Edit' modes to ensure proper submission.

              |--> Trainees are presented with a form to fill up their trainee profile. All fields are required.
         |--> Profile Details Section is split into two views - 'Display' and 'Edit'.
              |--> Display view displays the trainee profile details
              |--> Edit view displays inputs for trainee to edit their profile details and to change their password
                   |--> The password must always be entered twice to save the edited profile
